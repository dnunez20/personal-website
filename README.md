# This project has been retired as of 4/19/22
This was my first attempt at a personal website. I used Material UI to show off my resume and provide some links. Unfortunately I don't believe that I have enough content to need UX elements such as a sidebar. Instead I will begin a new with a renewed emphasis on simplicity and using new technologies to further my knowledge or react.
